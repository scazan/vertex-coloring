Vertex Coloring
======================

A simple tool for coloring a graph of connected vertices.

Javascript version adapted by Scott Cazan from the C/C++ code written by Duc Huy Nguyen.

An adjacency matrix will need to be generated beforehand and passed to the constructor (see link above for more details).
