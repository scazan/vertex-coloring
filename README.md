======================

A simple tool for coloring a square matrix given the matrix's dimensions.

Javascript version adapted by Scott Cazan from the C/C++ code written by Duc Huy Nguyen.

An input.txt containing the number of vertices followed by an adjacency matrix will need to be generated beforehand (see link above for more details).
